I'm making it so I have a place to work through some RubyOnRails courses on my weekends. 
Here are the courses: https://thoughtbot.com/upcase/rails 
My goal is to finish all 3 of them by the end of March 2022. 

I'm assuming it will take me 2x or 3x the stated length of the courses to actually work through them, based on past experience. Hopefully it's faster than that!

In working through these, I hope to build up some Rails knowledge to supplement what I'm learning at my current job, and to fill in the gaps from my 2021 bootcamp.
